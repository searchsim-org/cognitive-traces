# This directory stores annotation output files

Each annotation job creates a subdirectory with the following structure:

```
data/
└── {job_id}/
    ├── {dataset_name}_cognitive_traces.csv    # Main output file with cognitive labels
    ├── {dataset_name}_summary.json            # Job summary and statistics
    └── logs/
        ├── {session_id_1}_log.json            # Detailed agent logs for session 1
        ├── {session_id_2}_log.json            # Detailed agent logs for session 2
        └── ...
```

## Files

- **cognitive_traces.csv**: Incremental output file with all annotated events and cognitive labels
- **summary.json**: Job statistics, completion status, flagged sessions, and errors
- **logs/{session_id}_log.json**: Complete agent interaction logs for each session (Analyst, Critic, Judge decisions)

## Checkpoints

Checkpoint files are stored in `data/checkpoints/` and allow resuming interrupted jobs.
