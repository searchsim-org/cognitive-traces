The click on 'www polka dot pear com' from a vague query does not demonstrate strong intent or engagement. Instead, it appears to be a low-confidence action, likely taken out of desperation or curiosity rather than a clear information need. This aligns with PoorScent, as the user seems to be exploring without finding satisfactory options.",

The results viewed (e.g., 'how to write a resume') are clearly irrelevant, reinforcing the PoorScent classification. The Analyst's error does not provide a counterpoint.",
