This aligns with **LeavingPatch**, as the user has exhausted multiple reformulations and attempts without success. The Critic's consistent identification of **PoorScent** in prior events supports this conclusion, as prolonged poor scent often precedes patch abandonment. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the clear behavioral pattern.",
