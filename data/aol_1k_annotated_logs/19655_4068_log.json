The Critic argues the query 'us air force academy cadets list' lacks specificity and clear intent, which is characteristic of **PoorScent**\u2014a hallmark of vague or unsatisfactory information scent. The user\u2019s query does not demonstrate targeted intent (e.g., missing year, class, or purpose) and suggests dissatisfaction with prior results or an exploratory but unfocused need. The Critic\u2019s high confidence (0.85) and logical alignment with the schema further support this label.",

The user viewed 10 SERP results without clicking any, which strongly indicates **PoorScent**\u2014the results lacked sufficient information scent to warrant engagement. The Critic\u2019s reasoning (confidence: 0.8) aligns with the schema\u2019s definition: no clicks on a SERP implies the user did not find promising cues. The generic nature of the results (e.g., 'welcome us air force academy aog endowment') further supports this label, as they fail to address a specific need.",

The user\u2019s click on 'home u s air force academy' demonstrates they perceived *some* information scent in the result, sufficient to investigate further. This action is prototypical of **ApproachingSource**: the user is not merely reformulating queries (as in **DietEnrichment**) but actively engaging with a source based on its perceived relevance.

The query 'us air force academy spring break' is vague\u2014lacking a year, specific cadets, or context (e.g., '2024 schedule' or 'visitor policies'). This aligns with **PoorScent**: the user\u2019s reformulation does not reflect refined intent but rather a continued lack of satisfaction with prior results.

This behavior is a textbook example of **PoorScent**: the SERP fails to provide compelling information scent, as evidenced by the lack of engagement.
