The Critic's reasoning is compelling: the query 'kansas lottery...' contains an invalid control character, which strongly suggests a malformed or unintentional input rather than a well-formed, targeted query. This aligns with the definition of **PoorScent**, where the user's action does not reflect clear intent or promising information scent. The high confidence (0.85) from the Critic further supports this decision, as the error implies the user is likely struggling to articulate their need or receiving unsatisfactory results.",
