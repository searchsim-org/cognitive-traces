          "justification": "The query 'tiava...' is incomplete, lacks specificity, and demonstrates no clear intent or direction. The Critic's assessment (PoorScent, 0.85 confidence) is compelling, as the user appears to be struggling to articulate their information need, which is antithetical to the 'FollowingScent' label requiring a well-formed, targeted query. The Analyst's default 'FollowingScent' label (0.5 confidence) is unreliable due to an acknowledged analysis error, rendering it invalid. The absence of query refinement or contextual clarity further supports the PoorScent classification, as the user is not engaging with a promising information trail.",

          "justification": "The SERP results viewed ('ti avas girls com', 'free porno movies ti ava com', etc.) are vague, repetitive, and lack relevance to a coherent information need. The Critic's argument (PoorScent, 0.85 confidence) is strong: the user is passively viewing low-quality or irrelevant results without modifying their query, indicating no progression toward a goal. The Analyst's 'FollowingScent' label (0.5 confidence) is again invalid due to an analysis error. The user's inaction (no query reformulation or targeted clicks) aligns with PoorScent, as they are not actively pursuing a promising scent but rather exploring a low-value patch.",

          "justification": "The click on 'free porno movies ti ava com' reflects an exploratory but untargeted action. The Critic's reasoning (PoorScent, 0.8 confidence) is persuasive: the click lacks intentionality tied to a well-formed query, and the result itself is generic and likely unsatisfactory. The Analyst's 'FollowingScent' label (0.5 confidence) is unreliable due to an error. The user's behavior\u2014clicking on a low-scent result without prior query refinement\u2014suggests they are not following a strong information trail but rather engaging in low-effort foraging, characteristic of PoorScent.",

The Analyst's default label (0.5 confidence) is invalid due to an error.

The Analyst's 'FollowingScent' label (0.5 confidence) is erroneous due to an analysis failure.

The Analyst's 'FollowingScent' label (0.5 confidence) is invalid due to an error.

The Analyst's default label (0.5 confidence) is unreliable due to an error.
