The subsequent error (likely a system issue) further indicates no meaningful engagement or promising scent was found. The Critic's argument that this aligns with PoorScent\u2014where the user fails to find relevant resources\u2014is compelling. The query does not demonstrate targeted intent (a key requirement for FollowingScent), and the absence of clicks or further interaction supports the PoorScent label.",

The Critic correctly notes that viewing without clicking suggests the results lacked relevance or appeal. This behavior does not align with FollowingScent, which would require engagement (e.g., clicks) or evidence of strong information scent.

This aligns better with **ApproachingSource** (investigating a result based on scent) than PoorScent (which typically involves no engagement). The confidence is moderate because the prior context suggests weak scent, but the click is a clear signal of engagement. The Analyst's error is disregarded.",

There is no evidence of a well-formed query or targeted search, which are hallmarks of FollowingScent.
